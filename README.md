# Drupal tooling

Set of custom tools for managing Drupal installations. This for now only
provides a Drupal 7 basic support.

This repository is empty for now, but will grow depending on needs.

# Getting started

## Installation

@ todo

## Usage

# Console

@todo I should probably write something nice here.

# Todo list

 *  make Drupal path discovery more flexible...
 *  ... and configurable
 *  provide more commands
 *  make site install more flexible...
 *  ... and configurable

# Similarities with Drupal console

Yes, there is some, but this toolset is now for Drupal 7 only.
